## Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla JavaScript using ES6 modules for component organization
- **Component-based structure**: Modular design with separate managers for auth, customers, deliveries, reports, and dashboard
- **Real-time updates**: Uses Firebase Firestore real-time listeners for live data synchronization
- **Responsive design**: CSS-based responsive layout with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Chart visualization**: Integrated Chart.js for dashboard analytics and reporting

## Backend Architecture
- **Firebase Backend-as-a-Service**: Leverages Firebase for all backend services
